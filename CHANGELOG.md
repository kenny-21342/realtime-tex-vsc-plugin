# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Native TikZ drawing: pages rtex sends with a `native` drawing (pgf paths, fills, strokes, dashes,
  clips, opacity, axial/radial shadings, transformed node text) are drawn on the canvas instead of
  from the PDF. Needs an rtex with native drawing (realtime-tex docs/DISPLAY_LIST.md, "Native
  drawing"); with older builds those pages still come from the PDF.
- Cached TikZ pictures on native pages are found through the page's `pictures` spots and matched by
  cache key (`file:line`), so they stay in place while you edit around them.
- `realtimeTex.engine.repository` and `realtimeTex.engine.branch`: build the managed engine from a
  fork or a branch; **Update rtex Engine** and the daily check follow them.
- Render check (`npm run build:render`, `test/render/`): the preview's drawing code against MuPDF.

## 0.0.1

First release.

- Live preview that re-typesets the edited paragraph through rtex's fast path and installs background layouts as they arrive.
- Native display-list renderer for OpenType/TrueType fonts (glyph indices) and Type1/TFM fonts (through `pdftex.map`), with colors, rules, images and graphicx transforms. Pages it cannot draw exactly fall back to the background PDF, rendered by pdf.js.
- Two-way navigation: the preview follows the cursor, and a double-click in the preview jumps to the source.
- LaTeX errors and warnings in the Problems panel; a status pill and status bar entry that explain what the engine is doing.
- Export PDF, recompile, restart and stop commands; automatic main-file detection.
- Guided setup: walkthrough, **Check Setup**, one-click **Install rtex** (build from source) and an optional minimal TeX Live install.
- A first compile that fails or takes long explains itself (with the LaTeX log one click away) instead of waiting silently.
- Keep rtex up to date: **Update rtex Engine** pulls the latest realtime-tex, rebuilds it and restarts the engine; the `realtimeTex.updateCheck` setting (`notify` / `auto` / `off`) checks once a day.
- Follows realtime-tex `e5cab6a`: a full compile that produces no pages (`compile: Failed`) keeps the previous pages on screen with a banner (before the first layout it explains the failure); paragraphs rtex reports as `removed` are cleared; TikZ pictures reused from the picture cache are drawn from the PDF; new routing reasons are explained in plain words.
- Engine settings: `realtimeTex.engine.eligibility`, `realtimeTex.engine.fastBudgetMs`, `realtimeTex.engine.pictureCache` (passed to `rtex serve` only when changed, so older rtex builds still start); changing them restarts the engine.
- Removed the workaround for projects with subfolders: rtex creates them itself since `e324bef` (update rtex with **Update rtex Engine**).
- Debugging: `realtimeTex.debug.enabled` (and `realtimeTex.debug.directory`) makes rtex save a bundle for every live-engine failure; the extension announces each bundle with **Reveal Bundle** / **Copy Path**. **Open Debug Folder** opens the folder.
